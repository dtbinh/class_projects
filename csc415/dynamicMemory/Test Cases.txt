Functionality Tested 	Inputs 	Expected Output 	Actual Output 
			
Add 2 matrices of the same size 	"matrixA, matrixB "	matrixR 	Some values are incorrectly calculated. 
			
Add a matrix and a complex number 	"matrixA, complexA "	matrixS 	matrixS 
			
overload input operator	data into Matrix A	Matrix A	Matrix A
overload  assignment	Matrix B into Matrix A	Matrix A = Matrix B	Matrix A = Matrix B
Test Matrix B	Matrix B	Matrix B unchanged	Matrix B unchanged
